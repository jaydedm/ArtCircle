# ArtCircle
Created with JDK 8 using Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, Bootstrap, Google Maps and Geocoding APIs, ScrollReveal API, JavaScript, Thymeleaf, HTML5, jQuery, and CSS. 
I deployed this application using **Amazon Web Services** including: **Elastic Beanstalk**, **Route 53**, and **S3**. 
<br><br>The site is live and fully functioning with a database now! You can create your own secure account and post and search for your own opportunities live at [ArtCircle](artcircle.farm).
<br><br>The **purpose** of this project was not only to demonstrate the skills I've begun to develop, but to **provide a solution to a real problem** in the world. There is no other service that seeks to provide a way to connect job creators with job seekers in the arts the way that I have done. Since I've completed this project, I've met and formed a great relationship with a St. Louis start up called ConnectTheArts. We share the same goals and vision and I'm very excited to see what lies down the path with them. Check them out [here](connectthearts.com)!
